## How to play
### Introduction
####
Welcome to Snakes on a Plane! In order to play, you'll need a keyboard and mouse. 
Using the arrow keys, manuever your snake around the map while eating as many pellets as you can. The point of the game is to grow as long as possible so that you can enter combat and kill other snakes. You need 3 pellets to grow your snake, but pellets the same color as your snake count as 5 pellets!
####

### Combat
####
When you approach an enemy snake, the game enters 'combat mode' which simulates a snakes natural fight or flight mode. Time will slow down, making it easier for you to entrap your prey! To kill another snake, you must encircle them with your tail, and the enemy snake must run into your tail. Keep in mind, if you run into an enemies tail or head, you'll be killed! 
####

### Misc
#### 
Even though the map may _look_ endless, running out of bounds will result in instant death!

## Troubleshooting
There is a known bug in which enemy snakes sometimes will not spawn with a tail. This does not affect gameplay outside of slightly lowering the difficulty of the game.
